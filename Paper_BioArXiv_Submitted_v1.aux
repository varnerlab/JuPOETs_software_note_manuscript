If the new solution is accepted (based upon a probability calculated with the user supplied \texttt  {acceptance} function) it is added to the solution and objective archive. This solution is then perturbed during the next iteration of the algorithm. However, if the solution is not accepted, it is removed from the archive and discarded.

Inset right: Prototypical biochemical network with six metabolites and seven reactions modeled using the hybrid cybernetic approach (HCM). Intracellular cellmass precursors $A,B$, and $C$ are balanced (no accumulation) while the extracellular metabolites $A_{e},B_{e}$, and $C_{e}$ are dynamic. The oval denotes the cell boundary, $q_{j}$ is the $j$th flux across the boundary, and $v_{k}$ denotes the $k$th intracellular flux. Four data sets (each with $A_{e},B_{e}$,$C_{e}$ and cellmass measurements) were generated by varying the kinetic constants for each biochemical mode. Each data set was a single objective in the JuPOETs procedure. A: Ensemble simulation of extracellular substrate $A_{e}$ and cellmass versus time. B: Ensemble simulation of extracellular substrate $B_{e}$ and $C_{e}$ versus time. The gray region denotes the 95\% confidence estimate of the mean ensemble simulation. The data points denote mean synthetic measurements, while the error bars denote the 95\% confidence estimate of the measurement computed over the four training data sets. C: Trade-off plots between the four training objectives. The quantity $O_{j}$ denotes the jth training objective. Each point represents a member of the parameter ensemble, where gray denotes rank 0 sets, while black denotes rank 1 sets. \relax }}{19}}
